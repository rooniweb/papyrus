Project to create an online memory management platform for the [Universit√© Alioune Diop de Bambey](https://uadb.edu.sn/).

The project was initially modelled to be done with Laravel, but with experience we changed our approach by using a DMS like [Alfresco](https://docs.alfresco.com/content-services/6.1/develop/repo-ext-points/content-model/). We didn't want to reinvent the wheel with all the power Alfresco has to offer in terms of document management routines.
